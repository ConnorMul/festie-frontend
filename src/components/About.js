            <h2>CELL PHONES</h2>
            <p>Put your phone away and enjoy the moment. Snap a few pics and vids and then put it away!</p>
            <p>Be present and not on your phone unless you need to be! This will definitely enhance your experience</p>

            <br />
            <h2>Need Help?</h2>
            <p>We've all been there, need help for some reason? Ask for it. Someone around you will help you.</p>
            <p>Whether its locating your friends or you're festied out.. Ask for help and don't be afraid to offer help to others!</p>

            <br />
            <h2>Spread Positivity</h2>
            <p>Music Festivals are about COMMUNITY, we are truly all in this together for the week(end) and we are all enjoying this shared experience</p>
            <p>So give someone random a hug, smile big and enjoy the energy. Be YOURSELF and let your freak flag fly.</p>

            <br />
            <h2>Pick up your trash</h2>
            <p>No, seriously.. Clean up after yourself. Whether it's inside the fest or at your campsite, nobody wants a mess</p>
            <p>So take that cup you threw on the ground and find a trash can, bro.</p>

            <br />
            <h2>Have a Game Plan</h2>
            <p>Lets be real, you're gonna lose your friends at some point, whether you all decide on a meetup spot or not, you'll struggle to find them at some point.</p>
            <p>Don't panic, you'll find them eventually, text them and use things like totems, art and soundsystems at stages as reference spots!</p>

            <br />
            <p>Thats all for now! More to come in the future.... but the most important rule of all! Have Fun, Be Safe and Be KIND to both yourself AND others!</p>
